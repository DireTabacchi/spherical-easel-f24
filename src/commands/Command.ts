/** This class uses the Command Design Pattern to
 * wrap actions into objects.
 * The most important abstract method of this class is the `do()`
 * method, it performs the action wrapped by the object
 *
 * In order to support undo feature, each command must also
 * implement the restoreState() method to revert the effects of the action.
 * The constructor of every subclass must take the arguments needed to perform
 * the actual action of the command.
