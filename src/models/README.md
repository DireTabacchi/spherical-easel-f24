The files in this subdirectory manage the fixed (abstract) unit sphere data structure. Each class should contain a reference (called ref) to the cooresponding graphical (Two.js) object that lives in the plotables subdirectory. There should be uses (methods/functions or variables) that use the rendering/graphical tools (i.e. TwoJS currently) except ref the pointer to the rendering class.
