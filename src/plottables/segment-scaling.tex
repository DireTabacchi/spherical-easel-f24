Lines and line segments are managed as a \verb|Two.Group| of \verb|Two.Path|;
one path for the foreground semicircle and another path for the background
semicircle. The two semicircles are separated by the ellipse major axis.
This approach allows us to apply different visual styles to each semicircle.
In order to benefit from this organization, all drawing details must be
expressible in terms of the ellipse major and minor axes.

The red arc $AB$ is rendered by applying $y$-scale to the blue arc $UV$.
The $y$-scaling essentially projects $U$ and $V$ to $A$ and $B$ respectively,
using a projector line parallel to the minor axis
(hence perpendicular to the major axis).

Given the two mouse click positions $A$ and $B$, we can determine the locus
of $U$ and $V$ on the boundary circle using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the normal vector of the plane containing the red circle,
          which is the cross product $\mathbf N = [N_x, N_y, N_z]$ of the normal vectors at $A$ and $B$.
    \item Since the ellipse major is on the $XY$ plane and is also $\perp$ to $\mathbf N$, we can fix the major axis direction $\vec{\mathbf {PQ}} = [-N_y, N_x, 0]$
    \item Determine the angle $\alpha$ between $PQ$ and the $X$-axis
    \item Rotate the entire diagram by $-\alpha$, so now:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The major axis $PQ$ aligns with the $X$-axis
              \item All the projector lines $UA$ and $VB$ are parallel to the $Y$-axis
          \end{itemize}
          \textbf{After} this rotation by $-\alpha$ the following must be true: $a_x = r_x = u_x$  and $b_x = s_x = v_x$ and it is possible to determine the $x$-coordinates of $U$ and $V$ from the $x$-coordinates of the (rotated) mouse click positions.


    \item Since both $U$ and $V$ are on the unit circle, we can calculate the following quantities $u_y = \sqrt{(1 - u_x^2)}$ and $v_y = \sqrt{(1 - v_x^2)}$
    \item Determine the \verb|startAngle| ($\angle\; QOV$) and \verb|endAngle| ($\angle\; QOU$) and use these two values to determine which arc sections that must be rendered in foreground and background.

\end{enumerate}

Each semicircle is rendered in CCW order which implies that $\text{startAngle} < \text{endAngle}$.
