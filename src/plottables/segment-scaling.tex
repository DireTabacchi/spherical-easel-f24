\noindent
Given the positions $A$, $B$, and $M$ on the ideal unit 
sphere, computed as outlined below, here are the steps to draw line segment $AB$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $A$ and $M$ are not nearly antipodal (i.e. the angle between $A$ and $-M$ is bigger than $SETTINGS.nearlyAntipodalAngle$) then compute the cross product $\mathbf N = [N_x, N_y, N_z]$ of the vectors $A$ and $M$ to determine the normal vector to the plane containing the red circle (i.e. the plane containing $A$, $M$, $B$, and $O$). If $A$ and $M$ are nearly antipodal let $N = A \times B$. 
    \item The major axis of the ellipse is the intersection of the plane containing the red circle and the 
    $XY$ plane.  This means that in an orthogonal projection of the red circle plane onto the $XY$ plane the major axis of ellipse is in the direction $\vec \mathbf {PQ} = [-N_y, N_x, 0]$
    \item Determine the angle $\alpha$ between $PQ$ and the $X$-axis
    \item Rotate $A$ and $B$ by $-\alpha$, this will let us determine the $(x,y)$-coordinates of the ``unrotated'' copy of $A$ and $B$ and \textbf{after} rotation by $-\alpha$ the following must be true: $a_x = r_x = u_x$  and $b_x = s_x = v_x$ (because $PQ$ now aligns with the $X$-axis)

    \item Since both $U$ and $V$ are on the unit circle, we can calculate the following quantities $u_y = \sqrt{(1 - u_x^2)}$ and $v_y = \sqrt{(1 - v_x^2)}$

\end{enumerate}

This is going to be unstable if $A$ and $B$ are nearly antipodal and doesn't work if $A$ and $B$ 
are exactly antipodal.  This means that we need introduce a ``midpoint" of $A$ and $B$, called $M$,
that is dynamically updated as the user mouse downs (at $A$) and drags. The location of  $M$ \textbf{must be} constrained as the user mouse downs and drags. The location of the mouse moved (and potential mouse release location - i.e. $B$) event is \textbf{not} the location of $B$.

Let $A$ be the location in the unit sphere of the mouse down event. Initially, $M = A$. Now suppose that the user drags so that a mouse move event happens at location $C$ on the unit sphere. Let:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item $B$ be the displayed endpoint of the drawn line segment (could be temporary or final if $C$ is also a mouse release point), 
    \item $M_{old} = M$, 
    \item $U = \frac{1}{2}(A+C))$ and $T= \frac{U}{|U|}$ ($T$ is the unit normalization of the midpoint of the line segment $AC$ that goes through the sphere), and
    \item  $\alpha = SETTINGS.maxMidpointMovementAngle$. 
\end{itemize}
To compute $B$ and the new $M$ use the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the angle between $T$ and $M_{old}$ is less than $\alpha$ then $B = C$ and $M = T$.
    \item If not then $M$ is the point on the circle of radius $\alpha$ about $M_{old}$ that is closest to $T$ and $B$ is the point so that if you normalize $\frac{1}{2} (A+B)$ you get the point $M$.\\ To compute $M$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $F = M_{old} \times T$ and $G= F \times M_{old}$. (Notice that $F$, $G$, and $M_{old}$ form a unit orthogonal frame. To avoid numerical instability $F$ and $G$ might need to be normalized.)
        \item Then $M = \cos(\alpha)M_{old} + \sin(\alpha)G$
      \end{enumerate}
      To compute $B$:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item Let $H= A \times M$ and $J = H \times A$. (Again notice that $H$, $J$, and $A$ form a unit orthogonal frame. To avoid numerical instability $H$ and $J$ might need to be normalized.)
          \item Let $\theta$ be the angle between $A$ and $M$, then $B = \cos(2\theta)A + \sin(2\theta)J$. (Again $B$ should be normalized.)
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
