This subdirectory holds classes whose implementation depends on TwoJS. The focus of these classes is to take inputs from the cooresponding (via the pointer ref in the classes in the models subdirectory) classes in the models directory and oragnize the screen graph and ultimately to render the scene graph to the screen for the user to see. We do this because we are seperating out the ideal abstract data structure (the fixed unit sphere) and the rendering of that data stucture to the screen. Currently we do this with the package TwoJS, but if that changes then we can (more) easily switch to a new package.
