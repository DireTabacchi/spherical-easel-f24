::: tool-description
Measure the angle created by two lines, two line segments with a common endpoint, or three points.
::: tool-details</p> <ul><li>There are four different ways to select or create an angle to measure:
<ul><li>If a pair of lines, line segments with a common endpoint, or a line and a line segment with one endpoint on the line is selected, then which angle is measured depends on the order in which the lines or line segments were selected and the right-hand rule. If you place your right hand at the intersection points of the lines on the front of the sphere (or the common endpoint of the line segments or the endpoint of the line segment on the line) with your thumb pointing away from the center of the sphere and your fingers in the direction of the first selected line or line segment then as you curl your fingers toward the second selected line or line segment, the region swept out is the angle that is measured.</li> <li>If a triple of points is selected (or created) then the order in which the points were selected matters. The second point selected is the vertex of the angle. The angle measure is determined using the right hand rule as above assuming that there is a line segment (not necessarily shown or created but with length less than $\pi$) from the first selected point to the second point and a line segment (not necessarily shown or created but with length less than $\pi$) from the second selected point to the third selected point.</li></ul></li> <li>An angle marker is displayed indicating the angle that was measured. The vertex of the angle marker is the intersection point of the lines on the front of the sphere initially (unless the lines have common point defining them and then the common point is the vertex even if that common point is on the back side of the sphere when the angle marker is created), the common endpoint of the line segments, the endpoint of the line segment on the line ,or the second point selected.</li> <li>When an angle measurement is created, a row describing some of its properties (including its value and Measurement Token) will appear in the Measurement Section of the <a href="/userguide/#objects-tab">Objects Tab</a>.</li> <li>If this tool is activated with two lines, two line segments with a common endpoint, a line and a line segment with an endpoing on the line, or a triple of points selected, the above action is performed automatically.</li></ul> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Geometry Tip: Angles are tricky!</summary> <p>When two line segments with a common endpoint form an angle (a geometric object) there are two possible angle measures associated with the angle (one is bigger than or equal to $\pi$!).</p> <p>When two lines intersect, in a neighborhood of one of the intersection points, four angles are formed. There are two pairs of vertical angles, each with a common measurement.</p></details> <p>::: tool-title</p> <h2 id="coordinates"><a href="#coordinates" class="header-anchor">#</a> Coordinates</h2> <p>:::

Measure all aspects of a triangle.

Temporary points (which might be existing points, intersection points, or points on objects) are created at each click location and temporary line segments are created in order between the points as they are created (also assuming the line segment has length less than $\pi$). To complete the triangle you must click on the first point that was created.

Measure all aspects of a polygon
::: tool-details</p> <ul><li>There are several ways to measure a polygon:
<ul><li>Select an existing polygon.</li> <li>Select a cycle of line segments. A cycle of line segments is a ordered list of line segments $[s_1,s_2,s_3, \ldots, s_n]$ ($n\geq 3$), where for all indices, the ending point of segment $s_i$ is the starting point of segment $s_{i+1}$ and the indices are counted modulo $n$.</li> <li>Create the vertices of the polygon by clicking at a series of $n \geq 3$ locations. Temporary points (which might be existing points, intersection points, or points on objects) are created at each click location and temporary line segments are created in order between the points as they are created (also assuming the line segment has length less than $\pi$).

<ul><li>Polygon Object (unless it already exists)</li> <li>The length of each line segment.</li> <li>The measure of each of the angles in the polygon.</li> <li>The area of the polygon (This is hard because the polygon is not necessarily convex and may be crossed!
