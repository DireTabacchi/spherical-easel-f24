[This is a challenging tool to create because the shading will have to be done right! Imagine a polygon that is almost half the sphere -- the whole top or bottom half would have to be shaded! Perhaps it is not worth it...]</p> <p>::: tool-details</p> <ul><li>There are two ways to create a polygon:
<ul><li>Select a cycle of line segments. A cycle of line segments is a ordered list of line segments $[s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots , s_n]$ ($n \geq 3$), where for all indices $i$, the ending point of segment $s_i$ is the starting point of segment $s_{i+1}$ and the indices are counted modulo $n$.</li> <li>Create the vertices of the polygon, by clicking at a series of $n \leq 3$ locations. Temporary points (which might be new free points, existing points, intersection points, or points on objects) are created at each click location and temporary line segments are created in order between the points as they are created (also assuming the line segment has length less than $\pi$). To complete the polygon you must click on the first point that was created. Upon completion the temporary points and line segments are added to the arrangement.</li></ul></li> <li>The inside of the polygon is alway the region that is to the left of a person walking along the edges on the outside of the sphere.</li> <li>When a polygon is created, a row describing some of its properties will appear in the Polygon Section of the <a href="/userguide/#objects-tab">Objects Tab</a>.</li> <li>If this tool is activated with a cycle of line segments, or a collection of points, selected the above action is performed automatically.</li> <li>This is hard because the polygon is not necessarily convex and may be crossed! Perhaps restrict to convex polygons or only promise the user that the tool will work as described for convex polygons
