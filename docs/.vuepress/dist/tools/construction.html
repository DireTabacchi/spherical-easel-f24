Creates the angle bisector of a pair of line segments with an endpoint in common, a pair of lines, or three points.</p> <p>::: tool-details</p> <ul><li>There are three different ways to select or create an angle to bisect:
<ul><li>If a pair of lines is selected, then an angle is bisector is created depending on the order in which the lines were selected and the right-hand rule. If you place your right hand at one of the intersection points of the lines with your thumb pointing away from the center of the sphere and your fingers in the direction of the first line then as you curl your fingers toward the second line, the region swept out is the angle that is bisected.</li> <li>If a pair of line segments with a common endpoint is selected, then the angle bisector is created at the common endpoint.</li> <li>If a triple of points is selected (or created by clicking at three location) then the order in which the points were selected matters. The angle bisector is created at the second selected point. It is created using the right-hand rule as above assuming that there is a line segment (not necessarily shown or created) from the first to the second point and a line segment (not necessarily shown or created) from the second to the third point each of which has length less than $\pi$.</li></ul></li> <li>When an angle bisector is created, a row describing some of its properties will appear in the Lines Section of the <a href="/userguide/#objects-tab">Objects Tab</a>.</li> <li>If this tool is activated with a pair of line segments (with an endpoint in common) or three points selected the above action is performed automatically.</li></ul> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Geometry Tip: Angles are tricky!</summary> <p>When two line segments with a common endpoint form an angle (a geometric object) there are two possible angle measures associated with the angle (one is bigger than or equal to $\pi$!). However in this case both angle measures are bisected by a common line.</p> <p>When two lines intersect, in a neighborhood of one of the intersection points, four angles are forms. There are two pair of vertical angles, each with a common measurement, and each with its own bisector.</p></details> <p>::: tool-title</p> <h2 id="perpendicular-bisector"><a href="#perpendicular-bisector" class="header-anchor">#</a> Perpendicular Bisector</h2> <p>:::</p> <p>::: tool-description

Which polar point created depends on the order of the the points and the right-hand rule.
