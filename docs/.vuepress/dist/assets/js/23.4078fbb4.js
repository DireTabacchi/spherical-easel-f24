Using constructions (including intersections, bisections, tangents, perpendiculars, and others), measurements (including distance, length, angle, user defined and others), and mappings (including isometries and inversion) users can create precise geometric arrangements and numerically confirm conjectures in spherical geometry. In addition to being able to customize the look and feel of the displayed objects, users have the ability to load, save, export their arrangements (EPS, SVG, TikZ, animated GIFs) and import certain hand-created arrangements. If a user registers they will have the ability to create a URL to a server-side saved construction that can be publicly shared and to create a URL that points to a version of the application where the they can control which tools are available (intended primarily for instructors).")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("This documentation has two major parts: a "),a("RouterLink",{attrs:{to:"/languages/id/userguide/"}},[e._v("User Manual")]),e._v(" explaining many of the features of the application available to the user and a "),a("RouterLink",{attrs:{to:"/languages/id/design/"}},[e._v("Design Document")]),e._v(" explaining many of the choices we made while coding this application.")],1),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Spherical Easel is written in Typescript.
