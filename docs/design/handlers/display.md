## Move

:::
::: handler-description
[Move the location of a single object.](/tools/display.html#move)
::: handler-details

- This tool moves points, lines, segments, and ellipses that depend on free points.
- For the purposes of undoing, this tool does _not_ keep track of dependency from the point on one dimensional movements that result from moving one of the above objects. So if you create a line segment with a <span class= "class">SEPointOnOneDimensional</span> on it, if you move the line segment and then undo it, the <span class= "class">SEPointOnOneDimensional </span> will not necessarily be in the same location as it was ooriginally
