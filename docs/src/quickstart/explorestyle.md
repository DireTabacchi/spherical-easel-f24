# Adjust the Style and Display

## 7. Use the Rotate Tool

Activate the Rotate Tool <IconBase icon-name="rotate" /> in the "Display Tool" group and then mouse press and drag on the sphere to move your construction around on the sphere. You can rotate your construction repeatedly by releasing and clicking and dragging again. Drag your construction to the back of the sphere. Notice that when your construction is on the back of the sphere it is displayed in a slightly different style, you can adjust this the front style and back style behavior using the next step.

## 8. Adjust the Style and Labels: Points

Activate the Select Tool <IconBase icon-name="select" /> in the "Edit Tool" group.  Then select the vertices of the triangle by either
- Clicking and release on each of the three vertices of the triangle, while holding down the <KeyShortcuts macOpt pcAlt /> key or
- Pushing the <KeyShortcuts macLetter="p" pcLetter="p" /> (after which the points should be highlighted) and then clicking anywhere in the sphere Canvas **WITHOUT** moving the mouse.

Next select the Style Drawer <IconBase icon-name="styleDrawer" /> on the right side of the screen. A collection of icons should appear:
- <IconBase icon-name="labelTextEditTab" /> Text Editor: For adjusting the size and rotation angle of the selected labels.
- <IconBase icon-name="labelTextFamilyTab" /> Text Family Editor: Changes the decorations and font family of the label.
- <IconBase icon-name="labelColorFamilyTab" /> Text Fill Editor: Change the fill color for the label on the front and the back.
- <IconBase icon-name="closePanelRight" />: To close the Style Drawer.

Use the current multi-selected points to enlarge the points of the triangle. Next try to hide all but one of the labels and change the name (i.e. label text) in the remaining visible label to $A$.

::: tip
FUTURE PLAN: You can use [$\LaTeX$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to typeset your captions and labels by enclosing the appropriate $\LaTeX$ command or symbol code in dollar signs ($).  So $A$ is entered as \$A\$, $\theta$ as \$\theta\$, and $E= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ as \$E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\$.

## 9. Adjust the Style and Labels: Line Segments

Activate the Select Tool <IconBase icon-name="select" /> in the "Edit Tool" group and select the side of the triangle opposite $A$. Open the style drawer and make the label of this side visible and make the name $a$. See if you can change the style of the all line segments to red and thickened.
