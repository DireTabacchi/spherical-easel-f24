# Quick Start: Explore Equilateral Triangles

In the spirit of Euclid, we will guide the user through the steps to

- Construct a spherical equilateral triangle with common
  side length $a$ and angle $A$.
- Adjust the display style of the triangle and its location on the sphere.
- Numerically confirm the relationship $\tan(\frac{a}{2})^2 = 1 - 2 \cos(A)$.
- Add scripts to parts of the triangle so that one of the vertices is displayed only when $\angle A \geq \frac{\pi}{3}$ and the color of one of the sides of the triangle changes color depending on its length (i.e. the value of $a$).
