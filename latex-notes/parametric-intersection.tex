Finding the intersection between two parametric curves $P(s)$ and $Q(t)$ requires solving
the following function of two variables:
$$f(s,t) = P(s) - Q(t)$$
a function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$.


However, since in our app parametric curves are discretized into sample points connected by poly lines, evaluating the curves
on the sample points may fail to find the actual zeroes of $f(s,t)$. As an alternative, calculating the intersection
points is implemented as a 2-step process:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all pairs of discretized $(s,t)$ such that the distance between $P(s)$ and $Q(t)$ is very close (below some threshold)
  \item Refine the discretized pairs using bivariate Newton's iteration.
\end{enumerate}

Both steps rely on a distance function
$$d(s,t) = \sqrt{(P(s) - Q(t)) \cdot (P(s)-Q(t))}$$
a function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

In order to have an easier function to work with, we can use the squared distance instead

$$D(s,t) = (P(s) - Q(t)) \cdot (P(s)-Q(t))$$

The first partial derivatives of the above function are:

\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial D}{\partial s} = 2(P(s) - Q(t)) \cdot P'(s) \\
  \frac{\partial D}{\partial t} = -2(P(s) - Q(t)) \cdot Q'(t)
\end{align}

and the Newton's method iteration to update $(s,t)$ is given by
$$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    s_{k+1} \\t_{k+1}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    s_{k} \\t_{k}
  \end{bmatrix}
  -
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \partial D/\partial s \\
    \partial D/\partial t
  \end{bmatrix}
  D(s_k,t_k)
$$
